# [AWS-1 Project 1]()
# Project Description: Implementation and Analysis of Animal Control Data
* This project involves setting up a comprehensive data analytics platform using AWS services to manage the City of Vancouver’s animal control data. 
## Project Title: AWS Data Analytic Platform for the City of Vancouver - Part 1
* This project goal was to streamline data sourcing, storage, cleaning, transformation, and analysis, all while maintaining high standards of data security and governance. The platform was built with a focus on handling large datasets, securing sensitive information, and providing real-time insights through data visualization.
## Project Objective:
* The objective of this project is to design and implement a secure AWS-based Data Analytics Platform (DAP) for processing and analyzing the City of Vancouver’s Animal Control Lost and Found inventory data. The platform ensures data protection, efficient processing, and the provision of actionable insights to assist city officials in better managing animal-related cases.
* Designing & Implementing DAP.
## Methodology:
* The process of DAP designing and implementation is as follows.
1. Data Analytical Question Formulation
2. Data Discovery
3. Storage Design
4. Data Preparation
5. Data Injection
6. Data Pipeline Design
7. Data Cleaning
8. Data Structuring
9. Data Pipeline Implementation
10. Data Analysis
11. Data Visualization
12. Data Publishing

## Tools and Technologies:
- AWS S3: For secure data storage and versioning.
- AWS KMS: To encrypt and protect data.
- AWS Glue: For building the data pipeline and automating ETL processes.
- Amazon CloudWatch: To monitor system health and set up alarms.
- AWS CloudTrail: For tracking user activities and maintaining compliance.
- AWS Athena: For SQL-based querying of the processed data.


## Deliverables
- A fully configured AWS S3 environment with encryption, versioning, and replication.
- A scalable data pipeline via AWS Glue for processing the animal control data.
- Custom dashboards in Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and visualizing data trends.
- Documentation covering all architectural decisions, security measures, and monitoring strategies.
