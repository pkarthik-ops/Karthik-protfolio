# [AWS Project 1](https://pkarthik-ops.github.io/AWS-Project-1/)
# Project Description: Implementation and Analysis of Animal Control Data
* This project involves setting up a comprehensive data analytics platform using AWS services to the rate of animals found Matched in the year 2023 and add an Average for count of Matched animals feature additionally to support your analysis. 
## Project Title: AWS Data Analytic Platform for the City of Vancouver - Part 1
* The project aimed to create a robust data management platform that streamlines data sourcing, storage, cleaning, transformation, and analysis. It emphasizes high standards of data security and governance while efficiently handling large datasets. The platform also provides real-time insights through advanced data visualization capabilities.
## Project Objective:
* In this analysis, I have chosen to perform both the descriptive and the predictive analysis using the “Animal Inventory -Lost and Found” dataset from the City of Vancouver which is available in the open data. Self-explanatory In the descriptive analysis, we are working on the percentage of count where from the Total count of Animals noted we obtain Matched count in the year 2024.
* Designing & Implementing DAP.
## Methodology:
* The process of DAP designing and implementation is as follows.
1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Profiling
3. Data Cleaning
4. Data Pipeline Design
5. Exploratory Analysis
6. DAP Cost Estimation
   

## 
Tools and Technologies:
- AWS S3: For secure data storage and versioning.
- AWS KMS: To encrypt and protect data.
- AWS Glue: For building the data pipeline and automating ETL processes.
- Amazon CloudWatch: To monitor system health and set up alarms.
- AWS CloudTrail: For tracking user activities and maintaining compliance.
- AWS Athena: For SQL-based querying of the processed data.


## Deliverables
- A fully configured AWS S3 environment with encryption, versioning, and replication.
- A scalable data pipeline via AWS Glue for processing the animal control data.
- Custom dashboards in Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and visualizing data trends.
- Documentation covering all architectural decisions, security measures, and monitoring strategies.

# [AWS Project 2](https://pkarthik-ops.github.io/AWS-Project-2/)
# Project Description: Data Protection, Governance, and Monitoring
* This project involves setting up a comprehensive data analytics platform using AWS services to manage  to give a better protection on data monitoring and enriching the City of Vancouver’s animal control data. 
## Project Title: AWS Data Analytic Platform for the City of Vancouver - Part 2
* This project aims to design and implement a Data Analytics Platform (DAP) using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Data Enriching, Data Protection, Governance, and Monitoring
## Project Objective:
* Designing & Implementing DAP.
## Methodology:
* The process of providing Data Enriching, Data Protection, Governance, and Monitoring for DAP designed as follows.
1. Data Enriching
2. Data Protection
3. Data Governance
4. Data Monitoring
___
## Insights and Findings
- The platform enhances raw animal data by incorporating attributes from internal and external sources, improving its value for analysis in various sectors.
- Lost and found animal information is secured through encryption, replication, and AWS Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring sensitive data remains protected.
- A pipeline using AWS Glue and S3 processes the animal dataset, improving data quality, integrity, and relevance through filtering and transformation.
## Conclusion
* The analysis of the lost and found animal dataset from the City of Vancouver highlights the effectiveness of the AWS Data Analytics Platform in tracking animal recovery efforts. Key findings include a percentage calculation of matched animals for 2023, revealing trends in lost and found cases. The platform's robust data processing capabilities, including data cleaning and ETL pipeline design, facilitate accurate insights into animal control inventory management.
